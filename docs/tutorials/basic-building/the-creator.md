# Building in the Creator

When you open your first place, you'll be greeted by the creator's UI. It's not too overly complex to understand, but we'll go over the basics of how it works below to get you started on building your very own place to share with other players.

1. <b>Translation Tools</b> - These allow you to move an object within the editor itself.
2. <b>Snap settings</b> - The snap settings allow you to adjust your movement when using the translation tools for more precise or fine-tuned movements.
3. <b>Coloring / Visual Tools</b> - These tools let you color, or adjust the materials on bricks and other objects.
4. <b>Quick Buttons</b> - These buttons let you create the most commonly generated objects within the creator.
5. <b>Insert / Model / Tools<b> - These top menu buttons allow you to do the more in-depth creation spawning, or, testing your place in the case of `Tools`.
6. <b>Toolbox</b> - The toolbox allows you to spawn models that you, or anybody else published to the website.
7. <b>Explorer</b> - The explorer is your heirarchy to the place, this is where you'll find the placement of objects within your place.
8. <b>Properties</b> - The properties panel allows you to edit your selected objects or items (with the exception of scripts) to look or be moved in various places
