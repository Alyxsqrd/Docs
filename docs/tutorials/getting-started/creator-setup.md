## Launching the Creator

1. Go to the [Create](https://polytoria.com/create/) page.
2. Click the "Launch Creator" button or the "Edit" button on any place.
3. The Launcher will open and perform an update, if necessary.
4. The Creator should open and authenticate with Polytoria.

<strong>Note:</strong>
If you haven't downloaded the Launcher yet, you must download it from the [Places](https://polytoria.com/places/) page.

## Coding in the creator

To code in Polytoria Creator we recommend you to use a IDE (Integrated Development Environment). These are some of the widely used IDEs:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

These are examples, but you can use whatever IDE you want, even Notepad! When editing a script after installation, your system will ask where should it open the script file. Select the IDE you want and starting coding!
