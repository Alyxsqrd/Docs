# Introduction To Polytoria Creation

To get started with making your own places, you can use the Documentation and Tutorials here to learn about the Creator as well as the Scripting API.

View [Setting up Polytoria Creator](/tutorials/getting-started/creator-setup/) to set up the Creator and view [Understanding Creator's Interface](/tutorials/getting-started/creator-interface/) to learn the Creator Interface.

If you are ready to learn further, you may visit [About Scripting](/tutorials/basic-scripting/about-scripting/) to learn more about scripting on Polytoria or, [The Magic Brick](/tutorials/basic-tutorials/the-magic-brick/) to begin learning how to create things.
