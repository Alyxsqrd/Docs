# Datastore

### Description

Datastore is a data type returned by the [Datastore](../../static-classes/Datastore/) service. It contains all read and write functions to store data between sessions.

### Notes
If you are testing your place locally through Polytoria Creator, no requests will be made to the server and your data will not be saved after the session ends. You will need to upload your place to the website to test the datastore.
